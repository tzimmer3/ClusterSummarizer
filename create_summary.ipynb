    "prompt_text = f\"Perform aspect based sentiment analysis on the text below. - Provide overall sentiment score between 0 to 5 for the review- Provide a sentiment polarity score between 0 to 5 for each aspect  Example Text: • Culture: I believe our culture is positive, energized and more inclusive compared to 1991 when I started. We are all much more informed by leaders and we as leaders have taken the challenge of including our people in many discussions to enhance engagement. My strong belief is informed and educated workforce will support changes that they suggest for brighter future. • Communication: While the communication has improved, it could be more transparent, especially regarding company goals and decisions that impacts people. I do sense that our employees are worried and nervous about future of energy and their future in Chevron. This amplifies in smaller BUs, i.e., Chevron Oronite where the employees are constantly asking about their BUs role in energy transition, or in smaller refineries vs. larger sites. • OPG: We are on the right path. I believe the growing pains are over, and we are getting organized through both strategy setting and business planning. The area that we need to pay attention is how do we develop cross functional leaders for OPG. We may all be under OPG umbrella but our PDCs still suffer from similarity bias. • Benchmarking and competitive performance: We have strong processes to utilize the benchmarking data, create gap closure strategies, develop strategy to action lists. From my refining days and now in chemicals, we usually fall short on actions to results and keeping our teams focused and accountable on gap closure results. That is the focus for me to ensure we move from the lists of actions to actively prioritizing actions and delivering results.  • Digitalization and future of AI: Our teams are eager to change the way we work. The challenge is to create AI and digital tools we need time and resources to see the impact on changing the way we work. Example Output:    Overall sentiment score: 3.2Aspects with sentiment polarity score:- Culture: 5  - Communication: 3   - OPG: 3   - Competitive Performance: 2   - Digitalization: 3  /nTEXT:  {observation}\""
